# jsAudioClassesPlayer
A small but fully functional music player written in php and javascript. Designed to play online audio classes but can be used for music just as well! This application was written as a fiverr project, and it uses a lot of code from a youtube video that I will link at the end of the file. In order to use the application, you need a web server that has apache and php support (I used XAMPP as my local server and it worked flawlessly, since it has php and apache built in). 

The audio files must be placed inside the audio folder. You can change the name of the folder in the js script. Supported extensions are: .mp3, .m4a, .wav and .wma.
